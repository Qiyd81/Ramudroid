# Robot's Micrcontroller 

Using arduino Uno microcontroller board on ATmega328

**Why shoudl we control DC motors using Arduino ?**
Raspbian is not fit for real-time operations since program cannot be run strictly routinely based on the same clock cycle.
MCU such as Arduno maintains clock cycle precision.
