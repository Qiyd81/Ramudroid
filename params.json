For brains, there's a Raspberry Pi on board. It's got wireless connectivity. There's a camera for real-time image sensing of the environment\r\n\r\nFollowing are the resuable compoenets of this project :\r\n\r\n# m2mcommunication\r\nCommunication between the web client , mobile client , cloud server , robots and other control points is primarily on REST over Internet or Wifi. For the mobile clients in vicinity if the robot they may even connevt via BLE ( blue tooth low enery ).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Live streaming and image analysis\r\n\r\n##Rpi core control unit\r\n![alt Ramudroid v6.5] (http://s32.postimg.org/tkx97ih9x/Ramudroid_blacknwhite.jpg)\r\n\r\n##Web Console for Ramu Droid\r\n![alt web console ] (http://s32.postimg.org/xroj6320l/Ramudroidwebconsole.jpg)\r\n\r\n##Wiring Pi\r\nGPIO access library written in C for the BCM2835 used in the Raspberry Pi\r\n\r\n> git clone git://git.drogon.net/wiringPi\r\n> cd wiringPi\r\n> git pull origin\r\n> cd wiringPi\r\n> ./build\r\n> gpio -v\r\n> gpio readall\r\n",
